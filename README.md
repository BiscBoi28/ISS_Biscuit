# ISS_Biscuit
ISS repo was asked to be made, so i made it
1) added : on line 1
2) == is a comparitie operator meanwhile = is an assignment operator here on line 3
3) same as point 2 on line 4
4) exponentiation is ** and not *** which is a typo
5) fun(start,end) is passing 2 parameters start and end into the function meanwhile start end is just a typo
6) added : at the end of the line to declare the start of the function, otherwise it is a typo error again, which does nto explain the intendation below, leading to an error on line 10
7) same as point 6 on line 13
8) renamed the fucntion to call is_narc instead of an undefined function which leads to error
9) same as line 6 on line 13
10) renamed the function call to run the intended function to print_narcis_numbers on line 16
